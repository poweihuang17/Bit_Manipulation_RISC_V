<h2 id="clz">CLZ</h2>
<h3 id="status_clz">Status_CLZ</h3>
    * Verilog coding: Done, but just for 32 bit now. I will try to change it into configurable code for both 64bit and 32 bit.  
    
    * Verification: Not yet.  
    
    * Evaluation: Done,, as long as there is not a bug inside verilog code. Please see the analysis section. </br>
<h3 id="encoding_clz">Encoding Scheme</h3>
TBD
<h3 id="ref_clz">Reference implementation</h3>  
The reference implementation comes from [1]. <br/>
For code in verilog, please refer to CLZ.v.

From the verilog code and architecture diagram, I'm convinced that it's log(N) for timing.   

For further evaluation, we should use EDA tool to see the critical path for 32 bit and 64bit to verify that it's log(N) in timing.

<h3 id="todo_clz">Todo</h3>
    * Verification not yet.  <br/>
    * 64 bit version . <br/>
    * Synthesize to make sure it's log(N). <br/>
    * Area effect? <br/>
